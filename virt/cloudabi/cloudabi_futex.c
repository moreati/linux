/*
 * Futexes for CloudABI.
 *
 * On most systems, futexes are implemented as objects of a single type
 * on which a set of operations can be performed. CloudABI makes a clear
 * distinction between locks and condition variables. A lock may have
 * zero or more associated condition variables. A condition variable is
 * always associated with exactly one lock. There is a strict topology.
 * This approach has two advantages:
 *
 * - This topology is guaranteed to be acyclic. Requeueing of threads
 *   only happens in one direction (from condition variables to locks).
 *   This eases locking.
 * - It means that a futex object for a lock exists when it is unlocked,
 *   but has threads waiting on associated condition variables. Threads
 *   can be requeued to a lock even if the thread performing the wakeup
 *   does not have the lock mapped in its address space.
 *
 * This futex implementation only implements a single lock type, namely
 * a read-write lock. A regular mutex type would not be necessary, as
 * the read-write lock is as efficient as a mutex if used as such.
 * Userspace futex locks are 32 bits in size:
 *
 * - 1 bit: has threads waiting in kernel-space.
 * - 1 bit: is write-locked.
 * - 30 bits:
 *   - if write-locked: thread ID of owner.
 *   - if not write-locked: number of read locks held.
 *
 * Condition variables are also 32 bits in size. Its value is modified
 * by kernel-space exclusively. Zero indicates that it has no waiting
 * threads. Non-zero indicates the opposite.
 *
 * This implementation is optimal, in the sense that it only wakes up
 * threads if they can actually continue execution. It does not suffer
 * from the thundering herd problem. If multiple threads waiting on a
 * condition variable need to be woken up, only a single thread is
 * scheduled. All other threads are 'donated' to this thread. After the
 * thread manages to reacquire the lock, it requeues its donated threads
 * to the lock.
 *
 * TODO(ed): Store futex objects in a hash table.
 * TODO(ed): Add actual priority inheritance.
 * TODO(ed): Let futex_queue also take priorities into account.
 * TODO(ed): Make locking fine-grained.
 * TODO(ed): Optimize non-pshared locks.
